            <h3>Artistic Profile</h2>
                <p>Noah is an American musician from the town of Powder Springs, Georgia. He began
                    his private study at the age of 12.</p>

                <p>Before coming to London, he met weekly in the nationally respected Atlanta
                    Symphony Youth Orchestra and won a place in the National Youth Orchestra
                    (NYOUSA) in 2020. He is also seen regularly at the Heifetz International Music
                    Festival in Staunton, Virginia under the instruction of double bass composer and
                    chamber musician, Sam Suggs.
                    </p>
                <p>Since moving to London in Autumn 2021, Noah has performed with the Royal
                    Academy of Music's Symphony Orchestra, the Ealing Symphony Orchestra, the
                    Westminster Philharmonic Orchestra, the Nonesuch Orchestra, and took part in
                    several Oxford premieres, including Michael Gordonâ€™s Van Gogh Chamber Opera and
                    the first production of the Odyssey Ensemble.
                    </p>

                <p>He credits his success to his unique process of goal setting and practice planning
                    which synthesizes years of instruction and study. Some books which form the basis
                    of his teaching include; PracticeMind, the Inner Game of Tennis, and the works of
                    Burton Kaplan.
                    </p>

                <p>Noah is a rising third-year student at the Royal Academy of Music and is supported
                    generously by scholarship from the family of Alex Ross.</p>
